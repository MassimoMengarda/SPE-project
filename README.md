# SPE-project

This repository contain a proposed novel framework that combines a state-of-the-art disease spreading model based on mobility data with an economic model. The goal of this simulation is to estimate how the application of various countermeasures can impact both the number of saved lives and the economy of every sectors. In this report we will present a limited set of countermeasures to keep it as simple as possible, but the framework can be easily extended to simulate additional countermeasures. We will then compare our results with the real data gathered during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

The epidemic model is taken by the work of Chang et al. [1] and this repository can be seen as an alternative implementation of it, while for the economic part we use as base the I/O economic theory [2]. The report about the project is available at [docs/SPE_report.pdf](docs/SPE_report.pdf) while its presentation at [docs/SPE_slides.pdf](docs/SPE_slides.pdf)
